**Asus Z370-P II Motherboard + i7 9700k**

First go around I could not load into the MacOS Catalina installer.  This was resolved by updating the bios to the latest revision as of 8/21/20.

*Note:* Motherboard was returning `Invalid frame pointer` at first.  Examining the OpenCore logs I found that I was getting `MAT support is 0` which means that I needed to set the following settings which are different than the vanilla guide:

* Booter --> Quirks
	* EnableWriteUnprotector -> True
	* RebuildAppleMemoryMap -> False
	* SyncRuntimePermissions -> False

Tags:

* Success1: successful install and boot with OpenCore 0.6.0 DEBUG using the iGPU and default framebuffer.
